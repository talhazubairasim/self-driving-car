## 📌 Overview  
This project is a hands-on self-driving car system built using computer vision and machine learning. It demonstrates key components of autonomous vehicle logic — from perception to control — using practical datasets and simulation. The goal is to showcase how to create a self-driving car pipeline at prototype scale.

## 🎯 Key Features  
- Lane detection and analysis using OpenCV  
- Traffic sign detection or recognition (if applicable)  
- Behavioral cloning or steering model (based on CNN)  
- Integration of perception -> control loop  
- Simple simulation environment or recorded dataset for training/testing  
- Modular architecture so you can swap in new models or sensors easily

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the repo**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talhazubairasim/self-driving-car.git
   cd self-driving-car
2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set up dataset/configuration:**
Place driving footage data in data/ directory (or where you used)
Update config file if necessary: config.py or similar

5. **Run training / simulation:**
python train_model.py         # if training a model  
python run_simulation.py      # if running inference or simulator  

(Note: file names may differ in your repo — adapt accordingly.)

## 🚀 Deployment / Real-world Use

This prototype could be deployed on a small-scale vehicle platform (e.g., Raspberry Pi + camera)

For embedded use: convert model to TensorFlow Lite or ONNX

Add integration with sensors (lidar, ultrasonic) for full autonomy

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Add real-time lane change and obstacle avoidance

Integrate sensor fusion (camera + lidar + radar)

Expand dataset and improve model robustness under different weather/lighting

Use reinforcement learning for driving policies

Build a frontend dashboard to visualize driving metrics live
